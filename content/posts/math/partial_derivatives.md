## Derivative
$f(x,y)$ is a surface in $\mathbb{R}- 3$  

* it is the slope of surface at a point -> $\infty$ number of lines
* Find the slope of the tangent line to a surface at a point. we
  must give the tangent line a Direction
    * For now, we restrict our direction to in the 'X-Direction(Axis)' or
      in the 'y-Direction'
* To find the slope of tangent line in 'X-Direction', we must contain the tangent line in a plane parallel to teh xz-Plane
* Requires "y" to be constant
